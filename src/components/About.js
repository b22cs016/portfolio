            Hi, I'm Siddhesh Ayyathan, a pre-final year student pursuing Computer Science from IIT Jodhpur. I am currently exploring the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, busy  honing my DSA & development  skills. I have been active in my college life holding multiple POR's and had worked as a Consultant at World Quant.
            <br/>
            I like tackling complex problems and learning new skills. I was selected for Amazon ML Summer School '24. Furthermore, I am a KVPY Fellow securing AIR 290. I have done multiple projects ranging from DSA to Quantum Mechanics and everything in between!
